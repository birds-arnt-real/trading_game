Action items

1.  create a more optimal way to buy (buy -> sector -> buy -> ticker) is too much
2.  display portfolio before asking what they want to sell
3.  display the profit or loss from a sale from within the sell action (exchange)
4.  Create visual way to display price movement.  Linear graph would be ideal but even maybe
        (----- ++++++) or just {||||||||        }
5.

Thoughts
1.  500 stocks is too many unless I want to add a sector volatility_factor.
