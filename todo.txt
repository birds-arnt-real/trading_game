Action items

1.  (DONE) create a more optimal way to buy (buy -> sector -> buy -> ticker) is too much
2.  (DONE) display portfolio before asking what they want to sell
3.  display the profit or loss from a sale from within the sell action (exchange)
4.  Create visual way to display price movement.  Linear graph would be ideal but even maybe
        (----- ++++++) or just {||||||||        }
5. Create a randomizer for movement by sector
6. finish display by name
7. finish display by price
8. create way to only display N results at a time and then to move forward between the pages
9. confirmation of a succesful buy
10. Display portfolio before sell window, so user can see what they have to sell
11. (DONE) stream line selling process
12. clean up displaying portfolio with appropriate padding
13.  (DONE) round all doubles down to precision 2
14.  (LEFT OFF HERE ) Fix portfolio display to be cleaner

Thoughts
1.  500 stocks is too many unless I want to add a sector volatility_factor.
